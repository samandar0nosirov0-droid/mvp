Oops! Something went wrong! :(

ESLint: 8.57.0

You are linting ".", but all of the files matching the glob pattern "." are ignored.

If you don't want to lint these files, remove the pattern "." from the list of arguments passed to ESLint.

If you do want to lint these files, try the following solutions:

* Check your .eslintignore file, or the eslintIgnore property in package.json, to ensure that the files are not configured to be ignored.
* Explicitly list the files from this glob that you'd like to lint on the command-line, rather than providing a glob as an argument.

 ELIFECYCLE  Command failed with exit code 2.
